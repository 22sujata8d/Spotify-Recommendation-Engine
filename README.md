# Note

This branch /research/ is totally for testing out implementations before we push them to master.

Rule of working here is:
- Contributor makes an implementation or creates a change.
- PR is made .
- Maintainer reviews the PR.
- Approves changes and changes are reflected in research branch **and not master branch.**
- Research tools only when streamlined end to end go into the master branch.
- All discussions are open and happening in the gitter link (see master branch README.md).
